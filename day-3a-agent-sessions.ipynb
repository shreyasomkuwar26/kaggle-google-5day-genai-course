Drug discovery is one of the most exciting and rapidly evolving areas for AI in healthcare. New developments are emerging at a very fast pace. Here are some of the key recent trends and breakthroughs:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** This is a major leap. Instead of just screening existing compounds, generative AI models (like those based on GANs or VAEs) are now being used to *design entirely new molecules* from scratch that are predicted to have specific therapeutic properties. These models learn the \"rules\" of molecular structure and can generate novel chemical entities with desired characteristics like binding affinity, solubility, and metabolic stability.\n*   **\"Dreaming Up\" New Drugs:** Companies are using generative AI to explore vast chemical spaces that are inaccessible through traditional methods, potentially uncovering entirely new classes of drugs.\n\n**2. AI for Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Uncovering New Disease Targets:** AI analyzes massive biological datasets (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, patient data) to identify novel proteins or pathways that play a crucial role in disease development. This helps researchers pinpoint the most promising targets for drug intervention.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI can assess whether a particular disease target is likely to be \"druggable\" – meaning it can be effectively modulated by a small molecule or biologic drug.\n\n**3. Accelerated Pre-clinical Testing and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Predicting Compound Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI models are becoming more accurate at predicting how well a drug candidate will work and whether it will have harmful side effects, even before extensive lab testing. This helps de-risk the discovery process and prioritize the most promising candidates.\n*   **Optimizing Lead Compounds:** Once a promising compound is identified, AI can help fine-tune its structure to improve its potency, reduce off-target effects, and enhance its pharmacokinetic properties (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes the drug).\n\n**4. AI in Clinical Trial Optimization:**\n\n*   **Patient Selection and Stratification:** AI can identify patients who are most likely to respond to a particular drug based on their genetic makeup, biomarkers, or other characteristics. This leads to more efficient and successful clinical trials.\n*   **Predicting Trial Outcomes:** AI can analyze early trial data to predict the likelihood of success for the overall trial, allowing for adjustments or early termination if necessary.\n*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI helps identify new biomarkers that can be used to track disease progression or drug response in clinical trials.\n\n**5. AI for Drug Repurposing:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses for Old Drugs:** AI algorithms can sift through vast amounts of scientific literature, clinical trial data, and drug databases to identify existing drugs that could be effective against new diseases. This significantly reduces the time and cost of bringing a new therapy to market.\n\n**Examples of Recent Progress and Companies:**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** A leader in generative AI for drug discovery, they have brought AI-discovered drugs to clinical trials remarkably quickly.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Uses AI and automation to map human cell biology and identify new drug targets and therapies.\n*   **Exscientia:** Employs AI to design and discover new drug candidates with optimized properties.\n*   **Atomwise:** Utilizes deep learning for structure-based drug discovery, predicting how small molecules will bind to proteins.\n*   **BenevolentAI:** Leverages AI to analyze vast scientific knowledge to identify novel drug targets and potential therapies.\n\n**Key Innovations Driving This Progress:**\n\n*   **Deep Learning Architectures:** Advancements in neural networks, especially transformer models and graph neural networks, are crucial for understanding complex molecular interactions.\n*   **Large-Scale Datasets:** The availability of vast biological and chemical datasets is essential for training these AI models.\n*   **Computational Power:** Increased processing power (GPUs, TPUs) enables the training of these complex AI models.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just assisting in drug discovery; it's fundamentally changing the process by enabling the design of novel molecules, accelerating target identification, and optimizing pre-clinical and clinical development. This promises to bring new, more effective, and potentially personalized therapies to patients much faster than before.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned in the context of AI in drug discovery, which was:\n\n**2. AI for Target Identification and Validation**\n\nLet's dive deeper into what this entails and why it's so significant.\n\n**What is a \"Drug Target\"?**\n\nBefore we go further, it's important to understand what a drug target is. In simple terms, a drug target is typically a molecule in the body (often a protein or a gene) that is involved in a particular disease. By interacting with this target, a drug can:\n\n*   **Inhibit** a harmful process.\n*   **Activate** a beneficial process.\n*   **Modify** the function of a molecule.\n\nFor example, in cancer, a target might be a protein that helps cancer cells grow uncontrollably. A drug would then be designed to block this protein.\n\n**The Challenge of Finding the Right Targets:**\n\nTraditionally, identifying and validating drug targets has been a slow, arduous, and often serendipitous process. Researchers would spend years:\n\n*   **Observing disease mechanisms:** Through experiments and studying patient samples.\n*   **Forming hypotheses:** About which molecules might be involved.\n*   **Testing these hypotheses:** In laboratory settings, which can be time-consuming and expensive.\n*   **Validating the target:** Confirming that modulating this target actually has a therapeutic effect and doesn't cause unacceptable side effects.\n\nMany promising targets never make it to drug development because they are not well understood or are difficult to validate.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n\nAI is transforming this process by its ability to analyze and make sense of massive, complex biological datasets that are far beyond human capacity to process manually. Here's how it works:\n\n*   **Analyzing \"Omics\" Data:**\n    *   **Genomics:** AI can identify genes that are mutated or over/under-expressed in disease states.\n    *   **Proteomics:** AI can analyze the proteins present in cells or tissues and how their levels or modifications change during disease.\n    *   **Transcriptomics:** AI can study RNA molecules, which are involved in protein synthesis, to understand gene activity.\n    *   **Metabolomics:** AI can analyze the small molecules involved in metabolism.\n    *   **By integrating these different \"omics\" layers, AI can build a more holistic picture of the biological pathways affected by a disease.**\n\n*   **Identifying Novel Disease Drivers:**\n    *   AI algorithms can detect subtle patterns and correlations within these datasets that might indicate a previously unknown molecule or pathway that is critical for disease progression.\n    *   For instance, AI might find that a specific combination of gene mutations and protein levels is strongly associated with a particular type of cancer, suggesting a novel target.\n\n*   **Predicting Target \"Druggability\":**\n    *   Once a potential target is identified, AI can help assess its \"druggability.\" This involves predicting:\n        *   **Binding Sites:** Whether the target molecule has a specific pocket or site where a drug can bind.\n        *   **Modifiability:** Whether a drug can effectively alter the target's function.\n        *   **Essentiality:** Whether the target is truly essential for the disease and not redundant, which could lead to ineffective drugs or severe side effects if blocked.\n\n*   **Network Biology and Pathway Analysis:**\n    *   AI can map complex biological networks, showing how different genes, proteins, and molecules interact. This helps researchers understand the ripple effects of targeting a specific molecule and identify central nodes in disease networks that would be good targets.\n\n*   **Leveraging Real-World Evidence (RWE):**\n    *   AI can analyze de-identified patient records, electronic health records (EHRs), and claims data to identify correlations between certain genetic markers, treatments, and outcomes. This real-world evidence can provide valuable insights into disease mechanisms and potential targets.\n\n**Benefits of AI in Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Speed:** AI can analyze datasets and generate hypotheses much faster than traditional methods.\n*   **Accuracy:** By considering vast amounts of data, AI can uncover insights that humans might miss.\n*   **Reduced Cost:** By prioritizing more likely targets early on, AI can save significant research and development costs.\n*   **Discovery of Novel Targets:** AI's ability to explore complex relationships can lead to the identification of entirely new therapeutic avenues that wouldn't have been considered otherwise.\n\n**In essence, AI acts as a powerful magnifying glass and intelligent analyst, sifting through the immense complexity of biology to pinpoint the critical vulnerabilities in disease processes that can be exploited by new medicines.** This is a foundational step in the drug discovery pipeline, and getting it right with AI is crucial for the success of subsequent stages.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI for target identification and validation is diverse, ranging from large pharmaceutical companies with internal AI divisions to specialized biotech startups and technology providers.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
